        <h1> Day fourteen. New format </h1>
        <p> Yesterday I found out which image format is suitable for an avatar and added it to my blog. I like it. It looks quite nice. I decided to make a cheat sheet so as not to forget what other image formats exist and what they are used for. </p>

        <p> Here's my first GIF: </p>
        <img src = "files/gifka.gif" width = "250" height = "120" alt = "GIF Animation">

        <p> And here's the PNG format: </p>
        <img src = "files/portrait.png" height = "250" alt = "Cat portrait">

        <p> For example, there is such a format as JPEG: </p>
        <img src = "files/instructor-keks.jpg" width = "250" alt = "Instructor Cupcake">
