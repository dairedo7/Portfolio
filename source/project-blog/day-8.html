        <h1> Day eight. Very serious </h1>
        <p> What have I learned! The Keks training program for beginner kittens has a new master class - "How not to fall through the snow".  I was instructed to typeset a small teaching material. </p>
        <p> Surface pressure is calculated using the following formula: p = m * g / S. </p>

        <p> Given: p <sub> 1 </sub> = 1635Pa </p>

        <p> Calculate: p <sub> 2 </sub> = m <sub> 2 </sub> * g / S = 9kg * 9.81N / 0.03m <sup> 2 </sup> = 2942Pa </p>

        <p> where: <br>
          p1 - ​​foot pressure on the snow before the New Year holidays, <br>
          p2 - foot pressure after the holidays, <br>
          m2 - the mass of the cat after the holidays, <br>
          S - snow surface area, <br>
          g - acceleration of gravity. </p>
        <p> The maximum pressure that the first crust can withstand is 2000 Pa. </p>
        <p> It's hard to be a cat. </p>
