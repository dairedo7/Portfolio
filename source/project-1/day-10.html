       <p> <b> The first week has passed since I'm learning layout. </b> </p>

       <p> I think I realized that there is really nothing complicated about layout designer work. You just need to know what each tag is used for and apply them as intended. </p>

       <p> All that remains is to learn <strong> CSS </strong> and that's it, I'll be a cool layout designer! </p>
