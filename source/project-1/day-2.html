        <h1>Second day. I want to be a layout designer</h1>
        <p>I spent the whole evening on the Internet today. I read about the advantages of working as a layout designer. I was often distracted by different ads, but I remembered the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>you do a useful work</li>
          <li>you can work remotely</li>
          <li>there're always interesting people to get familiar with</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The desire to learn has increased dramatically.</p>
