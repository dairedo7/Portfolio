         <p>Welcome to my portfolio site. Until recently, I had no idea who a layout designer was, until I found interactive courses on both HTML and CSS and set a goal for myself to become one. I genuinely enjoy coding and trying to do my best to hone my web-designer skills to the highest degree.</p>

         <p>My name is Vladyslav, I speak 4 languages (Polish, English, Russian and Ukrainian) and I've been learning programming for almost 2 months. I enjoy creating different kind of web-pages and I currently explore my skills on the implementation of JS scripts to my page. I have decently developed my abilities for  reasonable, coherent thinking as well as stress coping methods, which comes in handy when I have a deadline to meet. Developing web-pages gives me a great pleasure and I'm constantly looking for opportunities to apply my skills and broaden up my knowledge of web-development! </p>

         <h2>Philosophical Reasoning Blog</h2>
          <p>By creating this web-page i learned how to use both 'float' property and some other pseudo-classes, I wasn't familiar with before.
          Apart from that, it gave me some better understanding of positioning with float and shred light on how to develop header & footer backgrounds using 'linear gradient' properties.</p>

         <h2>Venturion Law Firm Web-Site</h2>
          <p>Working over my 3-rd web-page I had a chance to polish up my html, css and JS skills even further. In order to develop this landing page I was required to study html, css, js and BEM methodology. By creating the project I've gained a lot of valuable experience on html & css coding, which led me to more profound understanding of the blocks semantics, their positioning and behaviour. To say even more, I also managed to broaden my knowledge of various css block and text properties as well as their values. Last, but not least - I've created a few different forms using JS and php scripts and then developed the validation methods for the aforementioned forms.</p>
