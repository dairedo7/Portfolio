        <p class="intro__description">Welcome to my portfolio site. I always had passion for coding and that's probably
          the reason why I started to code in the first place. The process of improvement and honing of my web-designer
          skills to the highest degree genuinely brings me lots of pleasure.</p>

        <p class="portfolio__description">My name is Vladyslav, I speak 4 languages (Polish, English, Russian and
          Ukrainian) and I've been learning programming for almost 2 months. I enjoy creating different kind of
          web-pages and I currently explore my skills on the implementation of JS scripts to my page. I have decently
          developed my abilities for reasonable, coherent thinking as well as stress coping methods, which comes in
          handy when I have a deadline to meet. Developing web-pages gives me a great pleasure and I'm constantly
          looking for opportunities to apply my skills and broaden up my knowledge of web-development! </p>

          <p class="portfolio__description">Working over my 3-rd web-page I had a chance to polish up my html, css and
            JS skills even further. In order to develop
            this landing page I was required to study html, css, js and BEM methodology. By creating the project I've
            gained a lot
            of valuable experience on html & css coding, which led me to more profound understanding of the blocks
            semantics, their
            positioning and behaviour.</p>

          <p class="portfolio__description">By creating this web-page i learned how to use both 'float' property and
            some other pseudo-classes, I wasn't familiar with before.
            Apart from that, it gave me some better understanding of positioning with float and shred light on how to
            develop header & footer backgrounds using 'linear gradient' properties.Working over this web-page I had a
            chance to polish up my html, css and JS skills even further.</p>

            even more, I also managed to broaden my knowledge of various css block and text properties as well as their
            values. Last, but not least - I've created a few different forms using JS and php scripts and then developed
            the validation methods for the aforementioned forms.</p>

          <p class="portfolio__description">Working over my 4-th web-page I mastered bootstrap library and improved my
            css and javascript skills. By doing so I also got more practical experience on how one needs to use classes
            and inheritance in css as well as refactoring techniques, which let me improve readibility and logical
            structure of my code. </p>
